# OhmRGB8x8
Simple 64 pads grid script for the Livid Ohm RGB and Ableton Live. 
It lets you use the Ohm RGB as a simple launchpad and map controls to CC. 

The script is based on the Amounra's one: https://github.com/aumhaa/m4m8. 
It has been cleared so there is no encoders and fader assigned but you can still map them. 


# Instructions  
All the files need to be placed to the Live's MIDI Remote Scripts : https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209072009-Installing-Third-Party-Control-Surfaces
- Download and install the scripts from the Amounra's repository : https://github.com/aumhaa/m4m8
- Download this one and replace the Livid_OhmModes_v2 folder. 

# Version
The script is available for Live 10.0.X and 10.1. You'll need to switch the branch to your version.
